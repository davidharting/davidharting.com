            <h2 class='font-serif font-semibold text-3xl'>About me</h2>
            <p>I am an experienced, full-stack software engineer from Westfield, Indiana. My focus in my career has been web apps that enable people to work with data. I am now working as an engineering manager at dbt Labs, building a web-based IDE for analytics engineers.</p>
            <p>At work, I am happiest working closely with product and design to navigate tradeoffs and to ship quickly. I am passionate about code review and testing.</p>
            <p>I believe in working hard and living slow. I enjoy life with my wife and my dog. I am fortunate enough to enjoy leisure time, which is filled with walks, wine, books, and games.</p>
