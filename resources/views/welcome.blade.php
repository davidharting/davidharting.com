                        I am an experienced, full-stack software engineer from
                        Westfield, Indiana. My focus in my career has been web
                        apps that enable people to work with data. For the past
                        4 years, I've worked on a Cloud IDE at dbt Labs.

                    <p>
                        At work, I am happiest working closely with product and
                        design to navigate tradeoffs and to ship quickly. I am
                        passionate about code review and testing.

                    <p>
                        I believe in working hard and living slow. I share life
                        with my wife Katie, my son AJ, and our dog Andi. I am
                        fortunate enough to enjoy leisure time, which is filled
                        with walks, wine, books, and games.
