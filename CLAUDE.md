This is a Laravel project for my personal website, davidharting.com.

## Development Setup

**If commands fail due to missing dependencies** (e.g., `vendor/autoload.php` not found, missing node_modules), you are in a fresh environment. Follow [docs/development-setup.md](docs/development-setup.md) to bootstrap before proceeding.

Quick check: if `php artisan test` fails with autoload errors, run the setup.

### Environments

- **Local macOS**: dev runs through mise + pitchfork. Use `mise run setup` once, then `mise run dev` to bring up the stack (postgres, octane, queue, vite). See the macOS section of [docs/development-setup.md](docs/development-setup.md).
- **Remote / CI / preconfigured Linux containers** (e.g. a cloud coding agent): tools are already installed — **do not install mise or run pitchfork**. Run `php artisan`, `vendor/bin/pint`, and `npm` directly, and follow the Linux/sandboxed section of [docs/development-setup.md](docs/development-setup.md). `mise run <task>` is a local convenience, not a requirement; the underlying commands work without it.

## Architecture overview

The site runs on Render.com from `render.yaml`.

```
Internet
  -> Render ingress
  -> web service: FrankenPHP Octane on $PORT
  -> Render Postgres on the private network
```

Supporting services:

- `davidhartingdotcom-worker`: runs `php artisan queue:work`.
- `davidhartingdotcom-backup-run`: Render cron job that runs database backups.
- `davidhartingdotcom-backup-clean`: Render cron job that prunes old backups.
- Cloudflare DNS points `davidharting.com` at Render. Cloudflare R2 stores public and private objects.

Operational notes:

- Render terminates TLS; the container listens on plain HTTP at `$PORT`.
- `render.yaml` owns service, database, worker, and cron definitions.
- Secrets are managed in Render, not committed to git. Prefer an IaC-friendly path, such as Render secret files, over long-term dashboard-only configuration.
- The web service `preDeployCommand` runs migrations and Telegram webhook registration before new web instances receive traffic.
- Historical note: this previously ran on a Digital Ocean droplet with Docker Compose. See `docs/projects/render-migration.md` for migration history.

### PR preview environments

`render.yaml` has `previews.generation: automatic`, so every PR gets its own preview environment (web + worker; the cron jobs are excluded via `previews.generation: off`). The web service's preview URL is always:

```
https://davidhartingdotcom-web-pr-<PR_NUMBER>.onrender.com
```

e.g. PR #155 -> `https://davidhartingdotcom-web-pr-155.onrender.com`. Preview environments set `IS_PULL_REQUEST=true` and `RUN_DEV_SEEDER=true`, and use the staging secrets/env group rather than production.

### MCP server

A public, unauthenticated, read-only MCP server is served at `https://davidharting.com/mcp` (`Mcp::web()` in `routes/ai.php`, server and tools in `app/Mcp/`). It exposes published notes and the media library — only information a logged-out visitor can already see. Verify manually with `php artisan mcp:inspector mcp`. See `docs/projects/mcp-server.md`.

### Database views

Postgres view definitions live as versioned SQL files at `database/views/{view}/{version}.sql`, holding only the `SELECT` body. `App\Support\DatabaseView::apply()` drops and recreates the view from one of those files.

To change a view: add the next version file, then a migration that applies the new version on `up()` and the previous one on `down()`.

```php
public function up(): void
{
    DatabaseView::apply('media_tracking_summary', 'v2');
}

public function down(): void
{
    DatabaseView::apply('media_tracking_summary', 'v1');
}
```

Never edit a version file that has already shipped — migrations reference it by version, so rewriting it changes what `down()` restores.

A new version arrives in a PR as a whole new file, so review it by diffing against the version it replaces:

```bash
git diff --no-index database/views/media_tracking_summary/v1.sql database/views/media_tracking_summary/v2.sql
```

#### Views block some table migrations

Postgres refuses to `DROP COLUMN` or `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE` on a column a view selects. A migration that needs to do either must drop the view first and reapply it afterwards:

```php
DatabaseView::drop('media_tracking_summary');
Schema::table('media', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->dropColumn('note');
});
DatabaseView::apply('media_tracking_summary', 'v3');
```

Because the view is created by a migration, a fresh database has it in exactly the same state production does at every point in history — so a migration that trips this fails in CI rather than only in production.

Renames are the quiet case: `RENAME COLUMN` and `RENAME TABLE` succeed, and Postgres silently rewrites the stored view to follow them (`note` becomes `remark AS note`). The live view and its `.sql` file then disagree until the next version is applied.

## Commands

- Use `ripgrep` to search files and `fd` to find files
- Use `php artisan` for Laravel commands
- Run tests: `php artisan test` (pass a file path to run one file)
- Run the whole suite fast: `php artisan test --compact --parallel` (~5.5s vs ~18s serial). Laravel creates and migrates the per-process `laravel_test_test_N` databases itself, so no setup is needed.
- Run tests with previously failed tests first, stopping on first failure: `php artisan test --compact --retry --bail`
- Verify a one-off behavior without writing a throwaway test: `vendor/bin/pest --agent='<php>'` (single outer quotes). See the `pest-plugin-agent` skill.
- Format code: `mise run format` (or `vendor/bin/pint && npm run format` where mise isn't available). Pint's Blade rule shells out to Node, so `node_modules` must be installed before Pint will run.

### Pest's Tia engine is unavailable here

The bundled `pest-testing` skill recommends `--tia` (Test Impact Analysis). **Ignore it in this project.** Tia needs a PCOV or Xdebug coverage driver, and our PHP is a Herd-lite static binary with neither — it cannot load extensions at all. `pest --tia` prints `TIA is skipped as it needs ext-pcov or Xdebug` and quietly runs the full suite, so the flag buys nothing. Reach for `--parallel` instead.

## Rules

### Way of working

- Work on only what I ask you to do, and one thing at a time. Focus changes to just the task at hand. Ask about refactors before doing them.
- Run `mise run format` before every commit (or `vendor/bin/pint && npm run format` where mise isn't available). Pint formats PHP and Blade (the `Pint/laravel_blade` rule, which shells out to Node/Prettier); Prettier formats JS/CSS/YAML/TOML. Both are enforced in CI.
- Make atomic commits with detailed messages
- Include tests as you go rather than at the end. Tests should be committed with the relevant application changes.

### Testing

- Write tests for all changes
- Focus on feature tests to get more leverage

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues on `davidharting/davidharting.com`, driven with the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles use their default label strings (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root, both created lazily. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4
- filament/filament (FILAMENT) - v5
- laravel/ai (AI) - v0
- laravel/breeze (BREEZE) - v2
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v13
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/octane (OCTANE) - v2
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) - v4
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v4
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/pail (PAIL) - v1
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v5
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v13
- prettier (PRETTIER) - v3
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
    - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Follow existing application Enum naming conventions.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== octane/core rules ===

# Laravel Octane

This application uses Laravel Octane, a long-running PHP server. The application bootstraps once and handles many requests within the same process.

- Never store request-specific state in singletons or static properties, because it can leak across requests.
- Use `config('octane.server')` to detect the active driver (`swoole`, `roadrunner`, or `frankenphp`).
- Prefer scoped bindings (`$this->app->scoped()`) over singletons for per-request services.

When working on Octane-specific features (concurrency, shared tables, memory, driver configuration, testing), invoke `octane-development` for detailed rules.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is a Laravel UI framework built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS. UIs are defined in PHP via fluent, chainable components. Follow existing conventions in this app.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices. If `search-docs` is unavailable, refer to https://filamentphp.com/docs.

### Artisan

- Always use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find available commands with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or run `php artisan --help`.
- Inspect required options before running, and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Always use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field visibility" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
->options(CompanyType::class)
->required()
->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
->required()
->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),

</code-snippet>

Use `Set $set` inside `->afterStateUpdated()` on a `->live()` field to mutate another field reactively. Prefer `->live(onBlur: true)` on text inputs to avoid per-keystroke updates:

<code-snippet name="Reactive field update" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
->required()
->live(onBlur: true)
->afterStateUpdated(fn (Set $set, ?string $state) => $set(
        'slug',
        Str::slug($state ?? ''),
)),

TextInput::make('slug')
->required(),

</code-snippet>

Compose layout by nesting `Section` and `Grid`. Children need explicit `->columnSpan()` or `->columnSpanFull()`:

<code-snippet name="Section and Grid layout" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
->schema([
Grid::make(2)->schema([
TextInput::make('first_name')
->columnSpan(1),
TextInput::make('last_name')
->columnSpan(1),
TextInput::make('bio')
->columnSpanFull(),
]),
]),

</code-snippet>

Use `Repeater` for inline `HasMany` management. `->relationship()` with no args binds to the relationship matching the field name:

<code-snippet name="Repeater for HasMany" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
->relationship()
->schema([
TextInput::make('institution')
->required(),
TextInput::make('qualification')
->required(),
])
->columns(2),

</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column value" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),

</code-snippet>

Use `SelectFilter` for enum or relationship filters, and `Filter` with a `->query()` closure for custom logic:

<code-snippet name="Table filters" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

SelectFilter::make('status')
->options(UserStatus::class),

SelectFilter::make('author')
->relationship('author', 'name'),

Filter::make('verified')
->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')),

</code-snippet>

Actions are buttons that encapsulate optional modal forms and behavior:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateEmail')
->schema([
TextInput::make('email')
->email()
->required(),
])
->action(fn (array $data, User $record) => $record->update($data)),

</code-snippet>

### Testing

Testing setup (requires `pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire` in `composer.json`):

- Always call `$this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())` before testing panel functionality.
- For edit pages, pass `['record' => $user->id]`, use `->call('save')` (not `->call('create')`), and do not assert `->assertRedirect()` (edit pages do not redirect after save).

<code-snippet name="Table test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
    ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
    ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Create resource test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;

livewire(CreateUser::class)
->fillForm([
'name' => 'Test',
'email' => 'test@example.com',
])
->call('create')
->assertNotified()
->assertHasNoFormErrors()
->assertRedirect();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
'name' => 'Test',
'email' => 'test@example.com',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Edit resource test" lang="php">
livewire(EditUser::class, ['record' => $user->id])
    ->fillForm(['name' => 'Updated'])
    ->call('save')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
'id' => $user->id,
'name' => 'Updated',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing validation" lang="php">
livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => null,
        'email' => 'invalid-email',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertHasFormErrors([
        'name' => 'required',
        'email' => 'email',
    ])
    ->assertNotNotified();

</code-snippet>

Use `->callAction(DeleteAction::class)` for page actions, or `->callAction(TestAction::make('name')->table($record))` for table actions:

<code-snippet name="Calling actions" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
'role' => 'admin',
])
->assertNotified();

</code-snippet>

### Correct Namespaces

- Form fields (`TextInput`, `Select`, `Repeater`, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (`TextEntry`, `IconEntry`, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (`Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (`Get`, `Set`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Table columns (`TextColumn`, `IconColumn`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Columns\`
- Table filters (`SelectFilter`, `Filter`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Filters\`
- Actions (`DeleteAction`, `CreateAction`, etc.): `Filament\Actions\`. Never use `Filament\Tables\Actions\`, `Filament\Forms\Actions\`, or any other sub-namespace for actions.
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

### Common Mistakes

- **Never assume public file visibility.** File visibility is `private` by default. Always use `->visibility('public')` when public access is needed.
- **Never assume full-width layout.** `Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, and `Repeater` do not span all columns by default.
- **Use `Select::make('author_id')->relationship('author', 'name')` for BelongsTo fields.** `BelongsToSelect` does not exist in v4.
- **`Repeater` uses `->schema()`, not `->fields()`.**
- **Never add `->dehydrated(false)` to fields that need to be saved.** It strips the value from form state before `->action()` or the save handler runs. Only use it for helper/UI-only fields.
- **Use correct property types when overriding `Page`, `Resource`, and `Widget` properties.** These properties have union types or changed modifiers that must be preserved:
    - `$navigationIcon`: `protected static string | BackedEnum | null` (not `?string`)
    - `$navigationGroup`: `protected static string | UnitEnum | null` (not `?string`)
    - `$view`: `protected string` (not `protected static string`) on `Page` and `Widget` classes

=== pestphp/pest-plugin-agent rules ===

## Pest Agent Plugin

`vendor/bin/pest --agent="<code>"` runs a one-off Pest assertion without creating a test file — the fastest way to verify that a change actually works (a route response, a model relationship, a rendered page, a form submission, mail firing, a screenshot, JavaScript errors, and so on).

### ALWAYS load the skill first

Whenever the user asks you to check, verify, confirm, or "make sure" something **works** — and it can be exercised on a route, page, form, model, job, mail, notification, or screenshot — you **MUST** load the **`pest-plugin-agent` skill before doing anything else**. Do not reach for a shell command, a throwaway test file, or manual reasoning first. This includes prompts like "verify the login form works", "did my change break X", "screenshot the homepage", "check this route returns 200", "make sure the mail fires", "is the form working", or any behavioral check after a Blade, Livewire, CSS, or JS change. Load the skill, then follow it exactly.

### NEVER fight shell escaping — use SINGLE outer quotes

Inline the snippet, but wrap it in **single** quotes, not double. Single quotes tell the shell to interpret nothing, so `$variables`, `\App\Models\User`, backticks, and `!` all pass through to PHP literally — **there is nothing to escape.** Use double quotes for PHP string literals inside:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest --agent='$user = \App\Models\User::factory()->create(); visit("/login")->type("email", $user->email)->press("Log in")->assertPathIs("/dashboard");'
```

Double outer quotes are the trap the shell springs on you — `--agent="…$user…"` makes the shell interpolate `$user` to nothing. Never do that, and never hand-escape `\$`.

The one thing single quotes can't contain is a literal single quote (an apostrophe in the PHP). Only then, fall back to a file: **Write** the snippet to a `.php` file (plain body statements — no `<?php`, no `use`, fully qualified class names) and run `vendor/bin/pest --agent="$(cat /path/to/snippet.php)"`. `"$(cat …)"` passes the contents verbatim without re-parsing. The plugin resolves the test suite's `uses`/namespace itself, so the file's location does not matter (a scratch/temp path is fine — it need not live under `tests/`).

### Browser checks require the browser plugin — ask before installing

Whenever the request can only be answered in a real browser — "does login work", "is the page responsive", "screenshot the homepage", "check the mobile layout", "does the button click through", "are there JS/console errors", or any visual/interaction check — the `visit()` browser API is needed. It comes from a **separate** package, `pestphp/pest-plugin-browser`, which is powered by Playwright.

If `visit()` is undefined (or the package is not installed), **do not install it silently — ask the user for permission first**, since it pulls in Node/Playwright dependencies and downloads browser binaries. Explain that the browser check needs it and confirm before running these commands:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-browser --dev   # the browser plugin (needs Node.js)

npm install playwright@latest                         # Playwright driver

npx playwright install                                # download the browser binaries

```

Once the user approves and it's installed, add `tests/Browser/Screenshots` to `.gitignore` so captured screenshots aren't committed. Browser assertions then run through the same `vendor/bin/pest --agent='…'` flow:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest --agent='visit("/login")->type("email", "test@example.com")->type("password", "password")->press("Log in")->assertPathIs("/dashboard");'
vendor/bin/pest --agent='visit("/")->on()->mobile()->screenshot(fullPage: false, filename: "home-mobile");'
```

For full usage — backend examples, browser testing, screenshots, responsive checks, combining frontend and backend assertions, RefreshDatabase guidance, and pitfalls — load the **`pest-plugin-agent` skill**.
