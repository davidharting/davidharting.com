This is a Laravel project for my personal website, davidharting.com.

## Development Setup

**If commands fail due to missing dependencies** (e.g., `vendor/autoload.php` not found, missing node_modules), you are in a fresh environment. Follow [docs/development-setup.md](docs/development-setup.md) to bootstrap before proceeding.

Quick check: if `php artisan test` fails with autoload errors, run the setup.

### Environments

- **Local macOS**: dev runs through mise + pitchfork. Use `mise run setup` once, then `mise run dev` to bring up the stack (postgres, octane, queue, vite). See the macOS section of [docs/development-setup.md](docs/development-setup.md).
- **Remote / CI / preconfigured Linux containers** (e.g. a cloud coding agent): tools are already installed — **do not install mise or run pitchfork**. Run `php artisan`, `vendor/bin/pint`, and `npm` directly, and follow the Linux/sandboxed section of [docs/development-setup.md](docs/development-setup.md). `mise run <task>` is a local convenience, not a requirement; the underlying commands work without it.

## Architecture overview

The site runs on Render.com from `render.yaml`.

```
Internet
  -> Render ingress
  -> web service: FrankenPHP Octane on $PORT
  -> Render Postgres on the private network
```

Supporting services:

- `davidhartingdotcom-worker`: runs `php artisan queue:work`.
- `davidhartingdotcom-backup-run`: Render cron job that runs database backups.
- `davidhartingdotcom-backup-clean`: Render cron job that prunes old backups.
- Cloudflare DNS points `davidharting.com` at Render. Cloudflare R2 stores public and private objects.

Operational notes:

- Render terminates TLS; the container listens on plain HTTP at `$PORT`.
- `render.yaml` owns service, database, worker, and cron definitions.
- Secrets are managed in Render, not committed to git. Prefer an IaC-friendly path, such as Render secret files, over long-term dashboard-only configuration.
- The web service `preDeployCommand` runs migrations and Telegram webhook registration before new web instances receive traffic.
- Historical note: this previously ran on a Digital Ocean droplet with Docker Compose. See `docs/projects/render-migration.md` for migration history.

### PR preview environments

`render.yaml` has `previews.generation: automatic`, so every PR gets its own preview environment (web + worker; the cron jobs are excluded via `previews.generation: off`). The web service's preview URL is always:

```
https://davidhartingdotcom-web-pr-<PR_NUMBER>.onrender.com
```

e.g. PR #155 -> `https://davidhartingdotcom-web-pr-155.onrender.com`. Preview environments set `IS_PULL_REQUEST=true` and `RUN_DEV_SEEDER=true`, and use the staging secrets/env group rather than production.

## Commands

- Use `ripgrep` to search files and `fd` to find files
- Use `php artisan` for Laravel commands
- Run tests: `php artisan test` (pass a file path to run one file)
- Run tests with previously failed tests first, stopping on first failure: `php artisan test --compact --retry --bail`
- Format code: `mise run format` (or `vendor/bin/pint && npm run format` where mise isn't available)

## Rules

### Way of working

- Work on only what I ask you to do, and one thing at a time. Focus changes to just the task at hand. Ask about refactors before doing them.
- Run `mise run format` before every commit (or `vendor/bin/pint && npm run format` where mise isn't available). Pint (PHP) and Prettier (JS/CSS/YAML) are both enforced in CI.
- Make atomic commits with detailed messages
- Include tests as you go rather than at the end. Tests should be committed with the relevant application changes.

### Testing

- Write tests for all changes
- Focus on feature tests to get more leverage

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.5
- filament/filament (FILAMENT) - v5
- laravel/ai (AI) - v0
- laravel/breeze (BREEZE) - v2
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/nightwatch (NIGHTWATCH) - v1
- laravel/octane (OCTANE) - v2
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) - v4
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v4
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v3
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11
- prettier (PRETTIER) - v3
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
    - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Follow existing application Enum naming conventions.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- This project upgraded from Laravel 10 without migrating to the new streamlined Laravel file structure.
- This is perfectly fine and recommended by Laravel. Follow the existing structure from Laravel 10. We do not need to migrate to the new Laravel structure unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Laravel 10 Structure

- Middleware typically lives in `app/Http/Middleware/` and service providers in `app/Providers/`.
- There is no `bootstrap/app.php` application configuration in a Laravel 10 structure:
    - Middleware registration happens in `app/Http/Kernel.php`
    - Exception handling is in `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
    - Console commands and schedule register in `app/Console/Kernel.php`
    - Rate limits likely exist in `RouteServiceProvider` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is used by this application. Follow existing conventions for how and where it's implemented.
- Filament is a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Laravel that lets you define user interfaces in PHP using structured configuration objects. Built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices.

### Artisan

- Use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find them with `list-artisan-commands` or `php artisan --help`.
- Inspect required options and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
->options(CompanyType::class)
->required()
->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
->required()
->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),
</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),
</code-snippet>

Actions encapsulate a button with optional modal form and logic:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Action::make('updateEmail')
->form([
TextInput::make('email')->email()->required(),
])
->action(fn (array $data, User $record): void => $record->update($data)),
</code-snippet>

### Testing

Authenticate before testing panel functionality. Filament uses Livewire, so use `livewire()` or `Livewire::test()`:

<code-snippet name="Filament Table Test" lang="php">
    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Filament Create Resource Test" lang="php">
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => 'Test',
            'email' => 'test@example.com',
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
        'name' => 'Test',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Validation" lang="php">
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => null,
            'email' => 'invalid-email',
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasFormErrors([
            'name' => 'required',
            'email' => 'email',
        ])
        ->assertNotNotified();
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Calling Actions" lang="php">
    use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
    use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;

    livewire(EditUser::class, ['record' => $user->id])
        ->callAction(DeleteAction::class)
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
            'role' => 'admin',
        ])
        ->assertNotified();

</code-snippet>

### Common Mistakes

**Commonly Incorrect Namespaces:**

- Form fields (TextInput, Select, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (for read-only views) (TextEntry, IconEntry, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Layout components (Grid, Section, Fieldset, Tabs, Wizard, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (Get, Set, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Actions: `Filament\Actions\` (no `Filament\Tables\Actions\` etc.)
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

**Recent breaking changes to Filament:**

- File visibility is `private` by default. Use `->visibility('public')` for public access.
- `Grid`, `Section`, and `Fieldset` no longer span all columns by default.
