He accomplishes just that. For a student and lover of science such as myself, ""more than superficial"" is not rich or deep enough. A great chunk of the book was simply review for me, especially in the physics, chemistry, and biology departments. However, I learned a great deal about paleontology, climatology, and geology, and I expect others will do the same. Bryson also has a knack for recognizing and exposing the differences between fact and theory, presenting the evidence and educating the audience to where the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. Perhaps best of all is Bryson's inexhaustible curiosity and appreciation and his continuous attempts to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and day-to-day life.  ",,,1,0

In comparison to War of the Worlds (the only other older sci-fi book I've read), it was less rich in scientific exposition, but richer in adventure, theme, and character depth. While the protagonist explores South  America, Doyle explores masculinity. The three supporting characters are all memorably eccentric yet knowable, relevant, and real.
